## Final Product

1. When players first enter the game, they need to create a room and wait for others to join the game! 

![Waiting for opponent](./docs/home.png)

2. The user creates a playroom and waits for others to join (For testing purpose, they can also open a new tab to create another player)

![Picking Tiles](./docs/room.png)

3. After all the players in the room are ready, the game starts, in the game everyone will take turns attacking the bricks, if that tile has a ship, the enemy will notify all players by burning that brick!

## About the Game

- When entering the game, each person sees a 32x32 matrix. 
- Each ship can be placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the board and cannot be partially placed off the board, and the player can only see his ship. 
- Then, each player takes turns selecting a tile on the opponent's grid, shooting at it. 
- If the cell contains the ship, it will catch fire. 
- If the cell does not contain a ship, it is marked with an X.

- The game ends when all users escape, or only 1 player is left who has not been completely destroyed
